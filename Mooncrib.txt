Street is haunted by woman who was running away pregnant, and ignored by the people on the street, which led to her death (persecuted by military?)
She dies and so does her baby, they both haunt the house with the blood-drentched moon
It is a closely guraded family secret
POV goes back and forth between her and the protagonist until the reveal that the woman's story is IN THE PAST!
We think that the house is haunted by the woman, then we think by the baby, and then we realize it's the house itself which hates us.
The protagonist becomes pregnant and leaves the house, ridding the house of its blood-moon
Protagonist finds the letters that have been hidden on the floorboards
